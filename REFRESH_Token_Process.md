I see the issue. The error suggests that we need to refresh the OAuth2 credentials. Let's verify a few things:
The redirect URI in the OAuth2 client should match what's configured in the Google Cloud Console. I've set it to the standard OAuth playground URL: 'https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground'
We need to make sure the OAuth2 credentials are properly configured in the Google Cloud Console:
Gmail API should be enabled
OAuth consent screen should be configured
The OAuth client ID should have the correct redirect URI
We need to generate a new refresh token using the OAuth playground:
Go to https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/
Click the settings icon (gear icon) in the top right
Check "Use your own OAuth credentials"
Enter your OAuth2 client ID and client secret
On the left side, find "Gmail API v1" and select the following scopes:
https://mail.google.com/
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send
Click "Authorize APIs"
Click "Exchange authorization code for tokens"
Copy the refresh tokenhell
