Chatbot: To choose the right role, consider your primary goal:

• Looking for a job? → Job Seeker (50 Ghana cedis)
• Hiring employees? → Employer (100 Ghana cedis)
• Want to provide training? → Trainer (100 Ghana cedis)
• Want to receive training? → Trainee (50 Ghana cedis)

All options require a one-time payment and email-only login. Which best describes your situation?
```

### 2. Payment Process Explanation

The chatbot provides clear information about the one-time payment structure:

```
User: How much does it cost?
Chatbot: Our one-time payment structure is based on role:

• Job Seekers: 50 Ghana cedis
• Employers: 100 Ghana cedis
• Trainers: 100 Ghana cedis
• Trainees: 50 Ghana cedis

This is a one-time payment that gives you lifetime access to your role-specific features with no recurring fees.
```

### 3. Email Verification Assistance

The chatbot helps users with verification issues:

```
User: I didn't receive my verification email
Chatbot: If you didn't receive your verification email:

1. Check your spam/junk folder
2. Verify you entered the correct email address
3. Click the "Resend Verification Email" button on the verification page
4. If issues persist, contact our support team at support@major.com
```

For Job Seekers and Trainers, the chatbot guides through the resume upload process:

```
User: How do I upload my resume?
Chatbot: To upload your resume (for Job Seekers and Trainers):

1. Log in to your account
2. Navigate to your dashboard
3. Click on the "Resume" section
4. Select "Upload Resume"
5. Choose your file (PDF, DOCX, or DOC formats, max 5MB)
6. Click "Upload"

Your resume will be stored in our system and used to match you with relevant opportunities or trainees.
```

Chatbot: Job Avenue is our exclusive platform where employers can post job opportunities and connect with qualified candidates, while trainees can access specialized training programs and job opportunities that match their skills and career goals.
```

```
User: How does Job Avenue work for employers?
Chatbot: As an employer, applying for Job Avenue allows you to connect with our admin to provide job details which will be matched with suitable candidates. This service is included in your one-time payment of 100 Ghana cedis.
```

### 6. System Transition Explanation

For returning users, the chatbot explains the transition:

```
User: Why has the system changed?

```

### 7. Legacy Question Handling

The chatbot gracefully handles legacy questions:

```
User: How do I search for jobs?
Chatbot: Our platform has evolved to a role-based system. If you're looking for employment, please register as a Job Seeker (50 Ghana cedis one-time fee). After registration and payment, you'll upload your resume and our system will connect you with suitable opportunities.
